## Description
* The Construction of this project is based around the use of Node.js with the added inquirers (npm @8.2.4) and (npm uuid). Under the initialization of "server.js" 
in your intergrated terminal the user will be granted a local host link to the working live application. This application provides users a live host "Note-Taker" program where user inputs are entered and saved for future use. All code base follows semantic structuring for other developers to follow and/or use for cross referencing.

## Usage
* Ensure both "express" and "uuid" installers have been downloaded to ensure all code runs correctly.
* Run "npm start" to initialize "server.js" and have local host link generated.
* Upon clicking of the generated host link the user will be brought to the first HTML page "index.html" where the user can then press the "Get Started" button
located at the centre of the page. Upon pressing the button users will be transferred to the "notes.html" and main section of the note taker application, simply enter and note "Title" and note "Text" and press save at the top right of your screen to save said note.

## Requirements
* NPM Inquirer @8.2.4
* NPM UUID
